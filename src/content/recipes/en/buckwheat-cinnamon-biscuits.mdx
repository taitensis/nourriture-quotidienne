ingredient_groups:
  - ingredients:
      - 60 g buckwheat flour
      - 60 g plain flour
      - 30 g icing sugar
      - 2 tbsp coconut oil
      - 2 tbsp sunflower oil
      - ½ tsp ground cinnamon
      - 1 tsp cold water (if needed)
      - 1 pinch salt
steps:
  - Mix the flours, icing sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl.
  - Add the coconut oil and sunflower oil, then rub into the flour until sandy.
  - Add the cold water only if the dough is too crumbly, and knead gently.
  - Roll into a log about 4–5 cm thick, wrap, and chill 15–20 min in the fridge (optional).
  - Slice into 16 biscuits.
  - Bake at 170 °C for 12–14 min, until edges are firm but still pale.
  - Cool completely on the tray; they will firm up as they cool.
notes:
  - Makes 16 biscuits, 2 per serving.
  - Try adding orange zest for extra flavour.
  - Pairs well with tea or coffee.
